In this go project, we used go routines and channel to optimize the calculation time for the matrix multiplication.<br />
At the end of this project, we found out that the calculation time will not have a significant change due to the powerful processors of the machine until a bigger size of matrix is tested. (eg. 1000\*1000 matrix) <br />
